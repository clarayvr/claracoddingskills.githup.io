		<h1>Hello world!</h1>

		<h2>☆ Who is Clara? </h2>

		<p>I am Clara, a 21-year-old student at Kedge Business School where I am pursuing a Master's degree in Marketing Digital and Sales. As a creative individual with a passion for music, spending time with friends, surfing, and watching sunsets, I bring a unique perspective to my studies.

		Apart from my interests, I consider myself to be a spontaneous person, which I believe makes me a valuable asset to any team or project I work on.</p>
